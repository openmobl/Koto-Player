			Figure out how to do album viewing with "various" artists.
				-from artist, launch all albums by artist
				-from album, launch "Album Artist" with album
				
				-view album launches album artist
				
				koto.content.view({type: "album", name: "alb name"}
					   {type: "artist", name: "artist name"}
				koto.content.albums.viewOne(albumName);
				koto.content.artists.viewOne(artistName)
			
			for .8
			-pick album art from now playing scene
			-m3u playlists
			-add "list item" for "Resume Now Playing"
			-transitions between album art scroller and now playing item
				
			-dashboard progress bar?
			-exhibition?
			-landscape?
			-bookmarks?
			-improved last.fm scrobbling
				
			sometime:
			-improve m functions, especially initialize. it sucks
			-sleep timer
			
		Known Issues:
			- on viewAlbum, other albums by artist include songs by other artists.
				ex: viewAlbum "The Resistance" by Muse. "Unknown Album" by Muse shows ALL songs with the album name "Unknown Album" regardless of artist.
